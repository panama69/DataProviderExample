# Background
This is a very simple example of UFT Pro (LeanFT) being leveraged by a custom framework and also utilizing the @DataProvider tag.

# Setup
The information on how to leverage UFT Pro (LeanFT) in a custom framework can be found:
[UFT Pro (LeanFT) Help](https://admhelp.microfocus.com/leanft/en/latest/HelpCenter/Content/HowTo/CustomFrameworks.htm)

The DataProvider example was pulled from [TNG junit-dataprovder](https://github.com/TNG/junit-dataprovider/wiki/Getting-started) with very minor changes.

# Execution
After excuting the Maven goal of test, take a look at the HTML report (RunResults\runresults.html) that is being automatically created from the use of the UFT Pro (LeanFT) Verify object.
